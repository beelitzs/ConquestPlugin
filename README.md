# Space Engineers Conquest Plugin
Conquest GameMode Plugin for SEServerExtender

This plugin creates a gamemode where players can build stations on asteroids to capture them.
To capture an asteroid a player will need to build a station within 500m of the center of the asteroid that meets certain capture requirements.
Captured asteroids will then count towards that players faction and controls that faction's position on the the faction leaderboard.
Every hour each faction will gain a number of faction credits equal to the total number of held asteroids that faction leaders can spend on refined materials.

This plugin is currently under development
Suggestions from the Space Engineers community are most welcome and will be reviewed.
